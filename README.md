# iOS Animation With Layers

This repository illustrates advanced techniques for native animations on iOS. Specifically, it shows how to animate bezier curves, labels and their content. These animations are more advanced than the standard `UIView` animation blocks introduced in iOS 4.0, because the latter is limited to merely a subset of animatable properties that iOS offers. As the underlying techniques are based on Quartz 2D the following will also work on macOS, although this requires changing the <code>UIKit</code> components to their Cocoa equivalents.

It has been adapted to compile on and work with Xcode 12 on macOS 10.15.
